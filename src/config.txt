# LINKEDBLOCKSENABLED Enables or disables the ability to rescope Data
# Store Memory blocks inside linked subsystems. If disabled, Data Store
# Memory blocks will be moved down to the lowest possible level, but remain
# outside of the linked subsystem. Data Store Memory blocks inside linked
# subsystems will not be moved. If enabled, moving Data Store Memory blocks
# across linked subsystem boundaries is allowed.
#
# To selectively allow Data Store Memory block movement for individual
# linked subsystems, set the parameter value to 0, and then "Disable Link"
# of the desired subsystems.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    0      to disable rescoping in linked subsystems
#    1      to enable rescoping in linked subsystems
